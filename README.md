#### 1. Installation
*To pull this repository to your local machine, start by creating a local repository and depending on your operating system, install an appropriate git file on your local drive. You will first need to create a local copy of the project on your local machine. To do this, navigate to the location where you want to setup your local resipository using the command line and create an empty folder. You might want to use the same name as name of project. Next, create a cloud GitHub account by going to [GitHub](http://github.com). Access will be granted upon your creation of a GitHub account and you should be able to spot the project name in you account. To get started, head back to your working directory and naviagate to the empty folder you created. Initiate a git file using **git init**. Create the file you want to track and start tracking by hitting **git add "file to track"**. Commit the changes using **git commit -m "reason for the commit"**. You can now link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository using **git remote add origin "link of GitHub project.git"**. For a live work space, clone your local repository and the remote repository using **git clone "link of GitHub project.hit"**. You are then ready to start collaborative work on this project.*

### 2. Project Usage
*To ensure good project usage, ensure you set-up your local reporsitory as a branch so that any commits that are pushed to the project come through as a sub project. Review codes by going to review on GItHub. You may want to raise any issues using the Create issue, Each issue raised should be done using a branch and for each issue, raise a pull request and submit. All chnages must be made in the local repository and pushed to the remote repository. Once the issue has been resoled and the request approved, merge the changes with the main and close issue with a comment*
